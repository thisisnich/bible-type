<title>Important rules to follow when planning tasks or when working on tasks</title>
<overview>
[progress.html](mdc:progress.html) contains many important detailed guidelines and tasks that should use to plan for tasks. There are a few key parts that help with ensuring a cohesive system design when multiple people work on different tasks.
1. Changelog - this helps us understand the context of previous changes to the features we are implementing
2. Project Structure - this helps us understand how and where we should write the files in an idiomatic fashion.
3. Implementation Details (file names, function names, interfaces) - these kinds of planning in advance help us not be overwhelmed with details, while ensuring that we can make the different large scale features work well with one another.
