# NextJS Convex Starter App

This is a starter application using NextJS and Convex, managed with NX for monorepo capabilities.

## Getting Started
### Pre-requisites

- Node.js 22 or later
- pnpm package manager
- Convex account - Register at https://www.convex.dev/

### Setup
1. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
2. Go to `services/backend` and run `pnpm dev` - this should prompt you to login to Convex and create a new project.
    Note: This will create a .env.local file with the CONVEX_URL environment variable.
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the `apps/webapp` directory and add the following:
   ```sh
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=<your-convex-project-url> # copy this from the backend .env.local file
   ```
4. Run `pnpm dev` in the root directory to start the NextJS application

## Project Structure

- `apps/webapp`: The frontend NextJS application
- `services/backend`: The Convex backend service

## Development

To run both the frontend and backend in parallel:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start:

- The webapp at http://localhost:3000
- The Convex backend development server

## NX Configuration

This project uses NX to manage the monorepo and run tasks in parallel. The main configuration files are:

- `nx.json`: Main NX configuration
- `apps/webapp/project.json`: Webapp project configuration
- `services/backend/project.json`: Backend project configuration

The dev command is configured to run both services in parallel without dependencies between them, allowing for independent development.

## Adding New Projects

To add a new project to the monorepo:

1. Create the project in the appropriate directory (`apps/` or `services/`)
2. Add a `project.json` file to define the project's targets
3. Update the root `package.json` to include the new project in the dev command if needed

## Deployment

### Convex Backend Deployment

To deploy your Convex backend to production:

1. Generate a deployment key from the Convex dashboard:
   - Go to your project in the [Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev)
   - Navigate to Settings > API Keys
   - Create a new deployment key

2. Add the deployment key to GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY_PROD`
   - Value: Your deployment key from the Convex dashboard

3. The GitHub Action workflow included in this template will handle deployment of your Convex backend automatically when you push to the main branch.

This setup allows for secure automated deployments of your Convex functions and schema without exposing your credentials.

# FAQ

## Why Convex?

Convex is chosen as the backend service for the following reasons:

1. **Simplicity of code generation and architecture**

   Convex follows a reactive paradigm that allows reactive queries from the client to cause automatic re-renders when a dataset has been updated. This significantly reduces complexity and amount of code required, while solving the problem of cache invalidation.

   Simple and less code required for a feature also means fewer chances for AI generated code to be incorrect.

2. **Transactionality and consistency**

   All convex mutations run "inside" of the database. Any error thrown in the mutation will result in an automatic rollback. This ensures that we are able to use a single language for both querying data and business logic, while maintaining transactionality.

3. **Simple end to end reactivity**

   Many platforms offer subscription to DB events (e.g. firebase, supabase). However, it still leaves a significant amount of code to transform the event into the actual state for your application. Convex solves this by simply providing the full state for the query's data, and does a re-render of that state when the data has been updated.

4. **Single language for frontend and backend**
